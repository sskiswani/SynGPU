Neural Networks on the GPU
===

A port of the SynfireGrowth neural network to the GPU, using CUDA.

`run.py` can be used to streamline usage, with the default execution pushing, compiling, and executing the source code.
```$ python27 run.py [-h] username password host [via-host]```

Arguments saved in a text file can be referenced by prefixing the filename with an `@` symbol, e.g. `python27 run.py @args.txt`.
